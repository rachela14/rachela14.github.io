        <h1>Is a wealthy country a happy country?</h1>
        <p> My aim is to use data analysis and visualisation to explore the correlation between wealth and happiness on a national level.  </p>
        <p> Since the Industrial Revolution, economic growth has been widely held as the way forward for a prosperous and happy country thus has been the key driver of leaders and policy makers across the world. However, I want to find out if this still holds true as economic growth in the West stagnates or if there are other factors that are more important in creating a positive and optimistic population. </p>  
        <p> To do this I have chosen to analyse the results of the World Happiness Report 2021. This report ranks 146 countries from most to least happy based on the perceptions and experiences of the people living there. </p>

        <div class="container1">
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1" ></div>

    </div>
    <p> </p>
        <p></p>
        <div class="container1"> 
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
        <p></p>
    </div>
      
    <p> The general trend shows countries having similar hues on both maps for example, Australia and Norway. However, there are notable variations to the trend such as Brazil which has a lower GDP per Capita ($7519) as indicated by its darker shade but a light shade on the happiness score map indicating a high happiness score (6.3). </p>
    <p> What I want to explore is why are the happiest countries not always the wealthiest and what other factors might contribute to a happy country beyond GDP per Capita. </p>
    <p> Income equality, gender equality and an educated population are all things countries strive for so perhaps these things could have a big impact on the happiness of a country. </p>


        <div class="container1">
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
    </div> 
    
    <p> My first instinct was to look at how income is distributed in each country to see if this was more important than a simple division of total wealth by population. </p>

    <p> Whilst there is a negative correlation that suggests a happier country has more income equality, the trend displayed is not the strongest. This suggests that there might be more to why different countries experience variations in happiness. </p>

    <div class="container1">
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div>

</div>    

    <p> I chose to compare the 10 countries with the lowest happiness score (where data was available) to the global average. I found that the percentage of students out of school in lower and upper secondary are much higher than the global average. This might suggest that higher attendance rates might contribute to happier individuals. </p>
        
    <p></p>
    <div class="container1">
    <img src="GEI_regression.png" height="300" width="400">
</div> 

    <p> The regression gave the results : y = 8.63x - 0.54 </p>

    <p> This suggests a positive, but weak, correlation between higher gender equality and higher levels of happiness in a country. Dividing the coefficient through by 10 (as gender inequality is on a scale between 0 and 1 but happiness is on a scale between 0 and 10), 0.86 is the mean increase in happiness when gender equality index increases by 0.1. </p>
    
   <h1> Conclusions </h1>
   <p> I found that GDP per Capita was important for happiness but that it was not definitive. There was some evidence that more gender equality, income equality or further education could account for some of the variation from the GDP per Capita trend, but no analysis gave definitive or certain answers. An alternative analysis might explore the importance of various national values and how these could play a major part in what makes a certain country happy. </p>

   <h1> Data Sources </h1>
   <p>For data on GDP per capita and gini co-efficient I used the World Bank website and data on ‘out of school’ rates were found on the UNICEF website. For all of these I was able to download the CSV files into excel to be cleaned.</p>
   <p>For data from the World Happiness Report and Global Gender Gap Index (World Economic Forum) I scraped the website www.worldpopulationreview.com rather than accessing the reports directly because they were both in PDF format which meant I couldn’t copy and paste values or scrape the report directly.</p>

   <h1> Challenges with Data </h1>
   <p>-	One challenge I had was trying to match two datasets together based on the country’s name for the Gini index scatter plot and the gender equality regression. To do this I used the ‘VLOOKUP’ tool in excel to match datasets and the ‘FILTER’ to identify which countries did not find a match between datasets.</p>
   <p>-	In order to match country names to the ‘topojson’ and achieve tidy data for the maps I used a python notebook linked here to change names of countries that varied slightly across datasets such as U.S./United States of America. (attach notebook ‘cleaning_happiness.ipynb).</p>
   <p>-	In the maps section of my project, I wanted to be able to directly compare the shades of a country across the two maps. However, happiness scores were less varied (between 1 and 10) than GDP per Capita (over $10,000 difference between lowest and highest) so the shades of GDP per Capita were clustered in the middle of the scale. To overcome this, I changed the colour scale for GDP per Capita to logs.</p>
